The goal is to complete the `Project` class to correctly manage `Engineer` objects according to specific ownership rules.

-----

### \#\# The Exercise: Managing a Project Team

You are building a system to manage engineering projects. A project has one **lead engineer** and a **team of member engineers**.

The ownership rules are:

1.  A `Project` has **exclusive ownership** of its `Lead Engineer`. If the project is shut down, the lead engineer is let go immediately. A lead engineer cannot be in charge of more than one project.
2.  Team members, however, are part of a general pool. A `Project` **shares ownership** of its `Team Members`. An engineer can be a member of multiple project teams. They are only let go when the last project they are on is shut down.

Your task is to use the correct smart pointers to enforce these rules.

-----

### \#\# üìù Your Task

Complete the `Project` class in the code below. You will need to:

1.  Choose the correct smart pointer types for `lead_engineer` and `team_members`.
2.  Implement the `set_lead_engineer` and `add_team_member` methods.
3.  Ensure that memory is managed correctly according to the rules.
